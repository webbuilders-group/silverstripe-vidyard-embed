Getting Started
========================
To start you will need an API Key from Vidyard as it is used to lookup the information to embed see [here for information](http://support.vidyard.com/articles/Public_Support/Using-the-Vidyard-dashboard-API/) on where to get this. Once you get your api key from Vidyard the user key will suffice. You must add the below to your config before you can add Vidyard videos using this module.

```yml
Vidyard:
    api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" #Vidyard API Key
```
